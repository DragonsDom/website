# House Details

Dragons Dom is a detached house with 3 floors, plus 3 cellars and a large garden with orchard.

## Attic

The attic is reached up a set of steps.  The final part is covered in some roofing - this should be lifted to one side before entering the attic door.

The attic also has a balcony space at the front of the house.

## Bedroom with Balcony

Large room with balcony.  Wood heater connection.

## Master Bedroom

Currently the electric sockets are not working, could be a fuse issue.

## Living Room

The door to the balcony does not close easily, best not to open it.  The far left lightswitch is the outside light.

Has a wood heater.

## Kitchen

Has stove with wood / coal heating, also an electric + gas oven.  

We recommend to use bottled water in the electric kettle as the tap water will cause scaling / white residue inside.

## Hallway

The tiles in the hallway were created by prisoners in the [Croatian Alcatraz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goli_Otok).  The oven unit stored there is functional, but only the hob, not the oven part.

## Downstairs Flat

Currently used to store the waste whilst we wait for recycling pickups.  There is also a room that could be fairly liveable.


## Well Room

Contains the pump (first hole on left) and the well (on the right).  The black room at the back was used to smoke meat.

## Small Cellar

Used for wood storage (small pieces, that will fit in the inside wood heaters).

## Medium Cellar

This room is used for "useful metal" and "useful wood" (not to burn).  Used to be the back part of a pig sty.

## Large Cellar

Plan is to turn this into an outdoor communal space, as it will be cool in the summer, dry in winter, and easy to seal from mosquitos.

## Top Garden

There is a metal part by the tree which is intended for controlled fires.  To the left is a house for 'burning wood' (large sizes, unsuitable for indoor fire).  Further left is an outdoor toilet.

Towards the end of the top garden is a nut tree, although it is not in good shape.

The top garden used to be used as a space for chickens and pigs (the middle cellar was where the pigs slept).

## Middle Garden

Contains a number of apple trees and a big fir tree that grew from a christmas tree.

## Bottom Garden

Contains the sewage at the end, furthest from the house.
