## Mixed Trash (Green)

Mixed (Green, unmarked) is collected every **Monday**.  Some people have a contract for 2 mondays a month, which is slightly cheaper, and might be worth moving to at some point.

Important - be sure to use the green bin with the sticker below!  This is the RFID chip, and they won't take the other one (without the sticker)
