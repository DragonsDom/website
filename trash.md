# Trash

Trash should be separted as follows:

* Paper / cardboard - YELLOW 
* Plastics - BLUE
* Mixed - GREEN

Yellow / Blue containers are collected alternate **Wednesdays** (one week yellow, one week blue)

Mixed is collected every **Monday**.  Some people have a contract for 2 mondays a month, which is slightly cheaper, and might be worth moving to at some point.
