# House Project

Dragons Dom is a community, non-profit endeavour focused on the development of a facility / place of refuge for visitors to Liberland.

It is currently in need of a lot of redevelopment and investment - the plan is to achieve this on a [Value for Value](/value4value.md) basis.  

For practical reasons (eg limited capacity), prior approval is always required before using [House Services](/services) - please see the [House Rules](/rules.md).
