# House Services

We offer the Services below to anyone who would like to visit Liberland.  Service usage _must always be agreed in advance_ (see [House Rules](/rules.md)).  We **do not charge for Services**, however - we do pay more attention to those who [donate](https://getalby.com/p/dragonsdom) to our cause.


- Use of house (toilet, kitchen, electricity, wifi etc)
- Night in Bedroom
- Night on Couch
- Camping
- Vehicle storage (secure)
- Bag / Bicycle storage
- PO Box (collect mail & parcels from DD)
- Anything else, just ask!

There are some services we explicitly do not provide, notably:

- Trash Disposal.  Do not bring trash to DD, not even for temporary storage.
- Hot Showers / Washing Machine.  Unfortunately, we don't have a proper water system (yet).
