# Value for Value

The Dragons **do not charge** for House Services - neither do we ask for personal cash or favours.

Instead we ask that you provide "Value for Value".  Whatever amount of benefit YOU perceive from using the house, you may give back as YOU decide.

The Value you provide (Tasks, Items, [donations](https://getalby.com/p/dragonsdom)) is always for the benefit of other guests, like you!  

Together we can make Dragons Dom a welcome refuge, and a springboard for those arriving to, returning to, or on holiday from, Liberland.

## Example Tasks you may perform:

- Collect grey water from the fountain by the roundabout
- Bring wood, for winter
- Cleaning, hoovering, etc
- Following and sharing our [Social Page on Nostr](https://satellite.earth/@npub18nfdmwvys3mk5fj7r7d25gmg4s68ns0u2qp0hgkyhy4m0g3ulwuqg6m9sm)
- Decoration / House maintenance (if you have the skills)

## Example Items we need:

* Pump for the well
* Registration for connecting to mains water (~600 euros)
* Computer for the CCTV (8gb ram with SSD)
* IP Cameras for the CCTV (with microphone, night vision, ONVIF)
* Tools - all kinds!
* Lawnmower
* Bricks, cement
* Doors
* Combination padlocks and lock boxes
