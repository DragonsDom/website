# Value for Value

The Dragons **do not charge** for House Services - neither do we ask for personal cash or favours.

Instead we ask that you provide "Value for Value".  Whatever amount of benefit YOU perceive from using the house, you may give back as YOU decide.

The Value you provide (Tasks, Items, [donations](https://getalby.com/p/dragonsdom)) is always for the benefit of other guests, like you!  

Together we can make Dragons Dom a welcome refuge, and a springboard for those arriving to, returning to, or on holiday from, Liberland.

## Valuable Services 

House Guests may bring value through the provision of services, such as:

- Bringing wood, for heating
- Cleaning, hoovering, etc
- Woodwork / fixing various items around the property
- Graphic Design / other digital services for the Dragons Dom brand
- Following and sharing our [Social Page on Nostr](https://satellite.earth/@npub18nfdmwvys3mk5fj7r7d25gmg4s68ns0u2qp0hgkyhy4m0g3ulwuqg6m9sm)
