# Value for Value

The Dragons do not charge for your use of House Services, however - we are the ones who pay for them, maintain them, and are responsible for them!

Instead we ask that you provide "Value for Value".  Whatever benefit YOU perceive that you received from using the house, you can give back as much benefit (to the house, or users of the house) as YOU decide.

Do NOT offer cash or favours to Dragons directly.  Instead you may purchase items, perform services, or [donate to the House Fund](https://getalby.com/p/dragonsdom).

## Services ANYONE can provide:

- Collect grey water from the fountain by the roundabout
- Bring wood, for winter
- Cleaning, hoovering, etc

- Decoration / House maintenance (if you have the skills)
