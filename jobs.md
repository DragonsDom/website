# Jobs

The following jobs are needed to help get Dragons Dom into tip top shape!  Note that there are also EU grants available.  We can ask the workman to prepare the project and also to claim the grant.

## Mains Water supply

The mains water has been ordered from the municipality, when it arrives, it needs to be connected to the house

## Well Water supply

There is a problem with the well (which is connected to the taps upstairs) as it does not maintain pressure.  Zoltan may be able to help with this.

## Sealing the Attic Window

At the back of the attic there is a gap onto the balcony. This needs to be sealed to prevent weather seeping in at the top of the house.

## Sealing the top of the attic steps

Currently loose roofing is placed over the gap, but this needs to be sealed up to prevent birds / wildlife etc from getting in.

## Brickwork in big cellar

Due to rain / water behind the brickwork, there is subsidence that needs to be addressed.

## Preparing / Decorating bottom apartment

This could / should be a standalone apartment!

## Fencing around top garden

We have the fencing units (in big cellar), which needs to be fitted around the top garden.  Concrete stubs are also available at the bottom of the garden by the steps to the gate.

## Solar Panels

The house gets sun all day - solar panels would be an obvious addition to the top of the house.
